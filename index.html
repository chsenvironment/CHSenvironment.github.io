        <p>Would you fight for your life if you had to?</p> 
        <p>Be prepared, because soon enough you will have to.</p> Never before has the earth undergone such drastic environmental damages.</p>

        <p>Most of us fail to acknowledge this issue properly and do our due diligence.</p>
        <p>However, you can still stop the destruction of our planet.</p> 
        <p>We alone can avert disaster by turning ourselves and others into environmentally responsible people.</p> <p>To solve our global crisis, we need the collective efforts of everyone.</p>
