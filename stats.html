        <h1>Plastics</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Plastic bottles can take up to 450 years to decompose.</li>
            <li>The world currently produces 330 million tons of plastic per year. In 1950 we only produced two-million tons. We are on track to produce one-billion tons of plastic per year by 2050!</li>
            <li>Half of the plastic that the world produces is only used once.</li>
            <li>The chemicals found in plastics are found in our food, water and the air that we breathe.</li>
            <li>Over a million birds and mammals are killed every year by plastics.</li>
        </ul>
